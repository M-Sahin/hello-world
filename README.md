# hello-world

Hi all, welcome to my Github page. Im and enthousiastic self-taught coder. 
I have a bachelor's degree in finance & management, but after a while I realized that it was nothing for me.
As I can't trow everything out the window and spend 4 years on a new bachelor's degree, I thought:
Why not make my hobby my work?
So that's exactly what I'm doing!
